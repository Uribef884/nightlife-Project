# Late Payment Handling Guide

## The Problem: 5-30 Minute Window

**Critical Issue**: If a user completes payment between 5-30 minutes (after your polling stops but before Wompi expires the transaction), you could have a **completed payment that you never processed**.

### Timeline:
```
0 min:  User starts payment ‚Üí PENDING
5 min:  Your polling stops ‚Üí TIMEOUT (user sees timeout page)
6-30 min: User completes payment ‚Üí APPROVED (Wompi webhook)
Result: User paid but you never processed the order!
```

## The Solution: Webhook + Late Processing

### 1. Enable Webhooks (Required)

**In Wompi Dashboard:**
- Set webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/wompi`
- Add event secret to your `.env`:
  ```env
  WOMPI_EVENT_KEY_SANDBOX=your_sandbox_event_secret
  WOMPI_EVENT_KEY_PRODUCTION=your_production_event_secret
  ```

### 2. Late Processing Logic (Already Added)

The webhook now detects when a transaction becomes APPROVED after being marked as TIMEOUT:

```typescript
// Detects late APPROVED transactions
if (status === "APPROVED" && existing.paymentStatus === "TIMEOUT") {
  // Process the order even though polling stopped
  await processWompiSuccessfulUnifiedCheckout(...)
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Normal Flow (0-5 minutes)
```
1. User pays ‚Üí APPROVED
2. Polling detects ‚Üí Process order
3. User gets success page
```

### Scenario 2: Late Payment (5-30 minutes)
```
1. User starts payment ‚Üí PENDING
2. 5 minutes ‚Üí Polling stops ‚Üí TIMEOUT
3. User sees timeout page
4. User completes payment ‚Üí APPROVED
5. Wompi webhook ‚Üí Late processing ‚Üí Order completed
6. User gets email confirmation
```

### Scenario 3: True Timeout (30+ minutes)
```
1. User starts payment ‚Üí PENDING
2. 5 minutes ‚Üí Polling stops ‚Üí TIMEOUT
3. User sees timeout page
4. 30 minutes ‚Üí Wompi expires transaction
5. No webhook ‚Üí No order processed
```

## Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ **No Lost Orders**: Late payments are automatically processed
‚úÖ **No Double Charging**: Idempotency prevents duplicate processing
‚úÖ **User Experience**: Users get their orders even if they complete payment late
‚úÖ **Reliability**: Webhooks provide backup to polling

## Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch:
- `[WOMPI] üö® Late APPROVED transaction detected!` - Late payment caught
- `[WOMPI] ‚úÖ Late APPROVED transaction processed successfully` - Order processed
- `[WOMPI] ‚ùå Failed to process late APPROVED transaction` - Error processing

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- Find transactions that were processed late
SELECT * FROM unified_purchase_transactions 
WHERE payment_status = 'APPROVED' 
AND created_at < updated_at - INTERVAL '5 minutes';

-- Find timeout transactions that might need manual review
SELECT * FROM unified_purchase_transactions 
WHERE payment_status = 'TIMEOUT' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 minutes';
```

## Testing

### Test Late Payment Scenario:
1. Start a payment
2. Wait 6 minutes (after polling stops)
3. Complete payment on Wompi side
4. Check logs for "Late APPROVED transaction detected"
5. Verify order is processed and user gets email

### Test Webhook Endpoint:
```bash
curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/wompi/ping
# Should return: {"ok": true, "path": "/api/webhook/wompi/ping", "method": "GET"}
```

## Fallback: Manual Processing

If webhooks fail, you can manually process late payments:

```typescript
// Check for late APPROVED transactions
const lateTransactions = await repo.find({
  where: {
    paymentStatus: 'APPROVED',
    paymentProviderTransactionId: Not(IsNull())
  }
});

// Process each one
for (const transaction of lateTransactions) {
  await processWompiSuccessfulUnifiedCheckout({
    userId: transaction.userId,
    sessionId: transaction.sessionId,
    email: transaction.buyerEmail,
    transactionId: transaction.id,
    cartItems: []
  });
}
```

## Summary

With this implementation:
- **No lost orders** from late payments
- **No double charging** from duplicate processing
- **Reliable webhook backup** to polling
- **Automatic late processing** without manual intervention

The 5-30 minute window is now fully covered!
